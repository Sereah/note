#### Coroutine

> It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.
>
> 可以在A线程挂起，在B线程恢复。



##### Coroutine builder

###### launch

1. Starts a new coroutine **without blocking the current thread**, it is a **asynchronous** builder. 不阻塞当前线程的情况下开辟协程，异步构建。

2. Needs to be used **within a coroutine scope**, because it(async) needs a scope to provide a context in which the coroutine will run. 需要在协程作用域中启动，因为它需要一个作用域去提供上下文，对其进行管理。

3. Return a **Job** object(coroutine task), can use the Job to **control the lifecycle** of the coroutine. 返回一个Job对象，管理协程的生命周期。

###### runBlocking

1. Starts a new coroutine and **blocks the current thread** until the coroutine and all its child coroutines finish executing, it is a **synchronous** builder. 阻塞当前线程开启一个协程，直到它和它的子协程都执行完毕。
2. Does not require an external coroutine scope because it **create its own scope**. 不需要外部的协程作用域，因为它是同步的，作用域自己构建。
3. Returns **T**, which is the result of the block execution. 返回代码块的执行结果。

```kotlin
fun main(): Unit = runBlocking {
	launch {
		
	}
}
```

###### coroutineScope

1. Declare our own scope. 自定义作用域。
2. It just suspends, releasing the underlying thread for other usages, that is the different from runBlocking. So, runBlocking is a regular function and coroutineScope is a suspending function. 仅仅挂起，不阻塞线程，需要suspend修饰。

```kotlin
fun main(): Unit = runBlocking {

}

suspend fun doPrint() = coroutineScope {

}
```



##### Structured concurrency

> a programming model that aims to make concurrent code easier to understand and manage. 更好的理解和管理并发。

1. The core idea is that child tasks should have a clearly defined context, and they must complete or be cancelled before their parent tasks finish. 核心是子任务有一个清晰的上下文，它们必须在父任务结束前完成或者取消，避免泄漏。

2. Kotlin Coroutine follow a principle of structured concurrency. kotlin协程遵循结构化并发。



##### Suspending function

> need to be used inside coroutines. 需要在作用域中使用。

###### delay

1. suspend current coroutine for a specific time, ***but does not block*** the underlying thread. 阻塞（挂起）当前协程，但是不阻塞线程。



##### Job

> A handle to the launched coroutine. 处理运行的协程。

1. Three status: **Active**, **Completed**, **Cacelled**
2. Funtion: 
   1. **join()**: will block current thread until job finish.
   2. **cancel()**: cancel the coroutine.
   3. **isActive**
   4. **isCompleted**
   5. **isCancelled**
   6. **start()**: active the job if it is not started by default.
